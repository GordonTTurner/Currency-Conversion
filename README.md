# Currency-Conversion
A shell command line program that allows a user to convert currency values within their terminal emulator.\
To run this program in the command line, run ```python3 currency.py lookup_currency base_currency```.\
Example: typing ```python3 currency.py gpd usd``` in the command line converts 1 Great British Pound to what it would currently be worth in U.S. dollars. (In this example, as of making this repo, the output is: 1 GBP is 1.31 USD)
